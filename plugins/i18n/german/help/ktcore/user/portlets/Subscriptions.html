<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Subscribing to a document or folder will cause email notifications to be sent to you via email, when actions are performed on a document or folder that you have subscribed to - i.e you will be notified when a document or folder is checked in, checked out, deleted, moved, archived etc.</p>

<p>Your notifications also display on the Dashboard. Unsubscribing prevents further notifications from being sent to you when further actions are performed on the document or folder after you have removed your subscription. </p>
