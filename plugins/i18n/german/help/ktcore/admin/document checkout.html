<h2>Document Checkout</h2>
<p>
This page lets you override the currently checked out status of a document and forces the document to be checked back in to the repository.
</p><p>
Forced check ins are used where a checked out document is urgently required back in the repository so that another user can check it out.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The document is checked back in to the repository without saving any changes that may have been made to it while it was checked out.
