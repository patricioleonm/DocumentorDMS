<h2>Role Administration</h2>
Roles include, for example, a document creator, a document reviewer, a document publisher, or writer, editor, developer, secretary, and so on.
<br></br><br></br>
Workflow actions - e.g. review, or publish - are typically assigned to a specific role. The role is granted permissions for working with the document, based on the type of tasks their role performs - e.g. reviewers need read and write permissions.
<br></br><br></br>
User Groups are allocated to Roles on a per-directory basis, and are inherited from the root folder of the DMS.
