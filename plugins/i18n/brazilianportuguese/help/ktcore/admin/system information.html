<h2>System information</h2>

<p>
KnowledgeTree provides a Support and System Information page in the Miscellaneous section of DMS Administration, which helps you identify and fix problems with your system.The Support and System Information page displays the output of a php_info command in a scrollable window. You may be asked to copy and send this information to the KnowledgeTree support staff if you require assistance with your problem.

<p>
Clicking the Download PHP Information link on this page automatically runs <strong>phpinfo</strong> and prints the results to the KnowledgeTree Document Management System.

Alternatively, please enquire about sending the information directly to the developer dealing with your issue.
