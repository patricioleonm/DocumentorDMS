<h2>Manage Users</h2>
<p>
You use the <b>Manage Users</b> section of <b>Users</b> and <b>Groups</b> to add or remove users from the KnowledgeTree Document Management System. You can also search for user details, or view a list of all the users that exist in the system.
</p>
<p>
The system uses the information you specified when you added the user or group, to retrieve their details from the authentication source. This allows verification of the user or group's login rights, and of the permissions they have for accessing information in the repository.
