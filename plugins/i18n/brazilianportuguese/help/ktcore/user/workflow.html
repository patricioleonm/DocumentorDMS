<h2>Workflow Overview</h2>
<p>Workflow allows you to assign a series of steps to the document creation and
management process.  For example, a "News" workflow might have documents which
go from <strong>Research</strong> to <strong>Draft</strong> to <strong>Under Review</strong>
to <strong>Published</strong>,
with different people participating in the document's
lifecycle at each stage. &nbsp;Naturally, not all documents have the
same needs in terms of workflow: &nbsp;Invoices (which must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">drawn up</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">maile</span>d, and then marked as <span style="font-weight: bold;">paid</span>) are very different from Marketing documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate this, KnowledgeTree&trade; allows the Administrator to
define a number of different workflows, each of which can be applied to
different documents as their organisation requires.</p>
