<h2>Archived Documents</h2>
<p>
Document Types are used to group together documents that have a similar function.
They also allow you to associate custom fieldsets for specific information that must be
included with a particular document type.
</p>
Let's say you create a document type called 'Invoice', and you want to ensure that
all documents of the type 'Invoice' contain the following fields: invoice number,
customer name, delivery address. You can group these fields in a fieldset called
Invoice Details, for example. And then you may want to create another fieldset for
the monetary values in the invoice, which you could call 'Amount'. The fieldset
Amount may include the following fields: Nett Item Value, Tax, Discount, and
Total Due.
<p>
There are two ways you can configure the document type - Invoice - and the
fieldsets you want to associate with this document type.
</p>

<p>
1. You can first create the document type in the Document Types section, and then
create one or more custom fieldsets in the Document Fieldsets section. The
collection of fieldsets you define are automatically listed in the Document Type
editing page. Having created the fieldset(s), you need to edit the document type you
created in order to to add (associate) the fieldset(s) you want to use in this document
type.
</p>
<p>
2. Alternatively, you can first create a set of custom fieldsets in the Document
Fieldsets section, and then create the document type. Having added the document
type, KnowledgeTree automatically opens the Document Type editing page, where
you can select the fieldsets out of the collection of fieldsets you have pre-defined in
Document Fieldsets, and which now display on the Document Type editing page.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Document types cannot be deleted in KnowledgeTree; they can only be disabled. Since a document type may be associated with a large amount of documents, deleting a document type may cause the loss of required metadata.
