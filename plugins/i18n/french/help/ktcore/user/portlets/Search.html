<h2>Search</h4>
<p>KnowledgeTree provides three versatile search options simple (quick) search, advanced search, and saved searches. Search is 
permissions-based, so the system only returns items that the logged in user is 
allowed to access. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> words shorter than 4 characters long (e.g. "the" or "for") are discarded from the search. Search also only ever returns fully matching words (e.g. "Know" will not match "KnowledgeTree"). </p>
<h3>Simple (quick) search</h5>
<p>Specify a search term to search all text - including 
document metadata and the contents of the following file types (if your 
administrator has configured these options): MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, 
Adobe PDF, and Plain Text files.</p>
<h3>Advanced Search</h5>
<p>Define criteria to launch a detailed Boolean search of the 
repository. This search allows more detailed search requests (using document 
metadata). For example, you can search for all MS Excel documents containing the 
word 'Invoice'.</p>
<h3>Saved search</h5>
<p>The saved search function allows KnowledgeTree 
administrators to pre-save useful advanced searches. For example, you may want 
to save a search that shows all documents in a completed state of a workflow. 
Saved searches save time on commonly used searches. </p>
