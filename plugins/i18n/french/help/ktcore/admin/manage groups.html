<h2>Manage Groups</h2>
<p>
Only a <b>User</b> that has been assigned to a <b>Group</b> is allowed to access the KnowledgeTree Document Management System.
</p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Groups can be members of other groups, and can have other groups as members.  These memberships pass the permissions set on to the parent group to user members of the member groups, possibly along a few chains.

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Let's say you create a new Group called Testers. Having created the Testers Group, you must assign the it to a Unit. You can name the Unit 'Quality Assurance'. So, the group named Testers is part of the unit Quality Assurance.
</p>
<p> 
Group: Testers<br>
Unit: Quality Assurance
