<h2>Dynamic Conditions</h2>
<p>
You use KnowledgeTree's Dynamic Conditions feature to set up the rules that will determine the permissions that may be applied to documents within a folder.These rules may be applied to a document's metadata, to its contents, or to its transactional information. Dynamic Conditions are applied on a per folder basis, and may be set up in the folder's Folder permissions page.
</p><p>
Having created a new dynamic condition, you need to assign it to a folder. You can also unassign dynamic conditions when they're no longer useful for the folder. </p><p>

<strong>Note:</strong> Dynamic Conditions are configured in the same way as Saved Searches.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Having defined a dynamic condition, you cannot delete it because that may change permission  assignments.
