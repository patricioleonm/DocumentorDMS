<h2>Administrator Mode</h2>
<p>
There are instances where systems administrators may be denied access to certain documents in the repository - management level documents containing classified information, for example.
</p>
<p>
However, because problems with these documents in the repository will also need to be fixed, administrators must be granted a way of overriding the controls in an audited manner that protects this information. 
</p><p>
Enabling Administrator mode allows system and unit administrators to view and manage all documents in the system, including those documents where they are normally denied access.
