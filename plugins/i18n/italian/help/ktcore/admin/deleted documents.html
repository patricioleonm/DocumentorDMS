<h2>Deleted Documents</h2>
<p>
This page allows you to restore or expunge documents that have been deleted in the KnowledgeTree repository.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Expunging saves disk space by permanently deleting documents that are no longer useful or required.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> By default, documents are restored to the folder location where they were originally deleted. If that folder no longer exists on the system, the document is restored to the root directory in the repository.
