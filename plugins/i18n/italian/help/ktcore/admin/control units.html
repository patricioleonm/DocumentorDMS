<h2>Unit Administration</h2>
<p>KnowledgeTree provides Units as a means of organizing groups. Units may be used to model your organization's business units.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> By default, each time a new Unit is created on the system, a Unit folder is created in the Organization (root) directory.</p>
