<h2>Authentication Sources</h2>
KnowledgeTree allows you to control access to the DMS for the users and groups in its database, using KnowledgeTree's own default authentication method - Database Authentication.
<br></br><br></br>
However, KnowledgeTree also allows you to add external authentication sources where your organization maintains its own list of users and groups that require controlled access to the DMS.
<br></br><br></br>
You can also modify or delete the details of external authentication sources and authentication provider information.
<br></br><br></br>
Note: You need to add the credentials of each user to KnowledgeTree (see Managing Users and Managing Groups) to allow the system to retrieve their details, even if you're using an external authentication source. 

For more detail, please refer to the Administrator Manual.
