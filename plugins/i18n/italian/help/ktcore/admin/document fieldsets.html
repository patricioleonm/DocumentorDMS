<h2>Document Fieldsets</h2>
<p>
Document Fieldsets allow you to associate custom metadata with documents in the
repository.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of document fieldsets:
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal</strong> - users are allowed to edit normal fieldsets only if they have been
   associated with the document type that is being edited.</li>
<li><strong>Generic</strong> - users may add and edit generic fieldsets to any document type in
   KnowledgeTree.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>   
<strong>Note:</strong> KnowledgeTree auto-generates an editable system name (namespace) for every
fieldset. Plug-ins use this namespace to call the fieldset, and to control how the fieldset works.
For more information on developing Plug-ins for KnowledgeTree, see the KnowledgeTree Wiki
at <a href ="http://support.knowledgetree.com/confluence/">http://support.knowledgetree.com/confluence/</a>
</p>

<h2>Document Fields</h2>
<p>
KnowledgeTree uses fields to group sets of related information into predefined
fieldsets. The custom fieldsets are then associated with specific document types, to
define the information (metadata) that should be included on documents of that
type.</p>
<p>
There are three classes of custom fields in KnowledgeTree:
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal</strong> - stores text metadata, such as invoice code</li>
<li><strong>Lookup</strong> - used to allow users to select from a predefined set of options</li>
<li><strong>Tree</strong> - used to allow users to select a metadata value by browsing a tree structure</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Managing Tree Fields</h3>

<p>
Trees can have multiple sub-categories and levels. You need to add sub-categories at
each level in order to organize the options into a 'tree'.</p>
<p>
The top level of the tree is called the root. The root, which holds all the top level
items, is not shown to the user, but it provides a single 'parent' to the top level items.</p>
<p>
For example, let's say you create a tree of the countries in the world. In this case, the
actual countries would be keywords - e.g. South Africa, England, Singapore, etc. And
the highest group of categories (the top level or 'root') would be continents - e.g.
Africa, Europe, Asia etc. The sub-categories, which fall below the top level 'continents'
could be 'regions' - e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa, Western Europe, South East Asia.</p><p>
KnowledgeTree allows you to create more sophisticated tree fields on the Edit
Lookup Tree page.</p>
