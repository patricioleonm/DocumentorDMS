<p class="descriptiveText">{i18n arg_appname="$appname"}This installation of #appname# allocates workflows
to documents by their location.  To specify the workflow to be used by all documents 
<strong>directly</strong> in this folder, please specify the workflow below.  Otherwise,
users will be able to choose the workflow, and some documents may have no workflow
attached.{/i18n}</p>

<p class="descriptiveText">{i18n}Note that documents which are moved into this folder
will change to use this workflow, and if their previous workflow was different
they will lose any progress they have made in that workflow.{/i18n}</p>
