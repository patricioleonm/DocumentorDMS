Note about icon themes:

Firstly, the icons we are using are drawn partially from "Silky" (see
CREDITS.txt in the knowledgeTree docs folder.) with some adjustments to
fit the naming convention, and to provide GIF versions for IE.

GIF versions override PNG versions in kt-ie-icons.css

Use of icons conforming to the Freedesktop "Icon Theme" spec is also possible.
