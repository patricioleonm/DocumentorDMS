GENERAL
-------

This folder includes the Nunit unit tests to unit test web services.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The unit tests were written for NUnit. NUnit 2.2.0 was used during development.

This framework was developed in Linux using Mono.

DATABASE
--------

Review helper.cs to see the configuration settings. UnixODBC is used. Sample config files:

 #  odbc.ini  

[ktdms]
Driver       = myodbcdriver
Description  = MySQL ODBC 2.50 Driver DSN
SERVER       = localhost
PORT         =
Socket 	     = /tmp/mysql.sock
USER         = root
Password     =
Database     = ktdms
OPTION       = 3

 #  odbcinst.ini  
[myodbcdriver]
Description  = MySQL ODBC 2.50 Driver DSN
Driver       = /usr/lib64/unixODBC/libmyodbc3.so


The document type 'NewType' must be added to the database for the document_type.cs unit test to run.


RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------

Edit the makefile to ensure that the WSDL_URL is directed to the correct location.

A makefile is provided which can be used as follows:

- make 		// will build and run the tests

- make clean 	// will remove all temporary and binary files

STATE
-----

The states of the tests is very alpha. Some of the tests are quite complicated, so we can probably split them.
