KnowledgeTree WebServices
=========================

Dependencies
------------

This is dependant on:
1) KTAPI
2) libcurl
3) PEAR:SOAP


Installation
------------

Assuming that <ktroot> denotes the base directory where KnowledgeTree is installed,
the following structure is expected:

<ktroot>/ktapi				- location of KT API
<ktroot>/ktwebservice		- location of KT Web Service
<ktroot>/var/uploads		- location of uploads

Installing libcurl
------------------

Curl and libcurl are available from http://curl.haxx.se/ and http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ respectively.

You may need to edit your php.ini file. You may require to add something like:

extension=php_curl.dll


Installing PEAR::SOAP
---------------------

We assume PEAR::SOAP will be available in the <ktroot>/thirdparty/pear/SOAP directory.

Please review http://pear.php.net/ on the installation procedure if a newer version is required.

Configuration
-------------

The following can be configured in the configuration file (config.ini):

[webservices]

; the upload directory 
uploadDirectory = ${varDirectory}/uploads

; this is the location for downloads from calls to web services
downloadUrl = ${rootUrl}/ktwebservice/download.php

; Files must be uploaded before they can be interacted with
uploadExpiry = 30

; The Web Service download request just makes a file temporarily available. If it is not downloaded in the time frame below, it will not be available.
downloadExpiry = 30

; It is recommended that the administrator add some random text here. This will prevent different installations generating hashes in the same manner.

Using Web Services
------------------

The WSDL for the KnowledgeTree Web Service can be referenced as follows:

http://ktdms.trunk/ktwebservice/?wsdl

or

http://ktdms.trunk/ktwebservice/webservice.php?wsdl

The KTWS API package provides an object oriented wrapping of the web service functionality.
