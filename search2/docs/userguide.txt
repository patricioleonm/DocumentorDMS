SEARCH2 User Guide
==================

Note: The most up-to-date version of this can be found on the wiki at http://wiki.knowledgetree.com/Search2

The new search engine provides for more complicated search expressions than were possible in the past.

Expression Language
-------------------

The core of the search engine is the 'expression language'.

Expressions may be built up using the following grammar:
expr ::= expr { AND | OR } expr
expr ::= NOT expr
expr ::= (expr)
expr ::= expr { < | <= | = | > | >= | CONTAINS |STARTS WITH | ENDS WITH } value
expr ::= field BETWEEN value AND value
expr ::= field DOES [ NOT ] CONTAIN value
expr ::= field IS [ NOT ] LIKE value
value ::= "search text here"

A field may be one of the following:
CheckedOut , CheckedOutBy , CheckedoutDelta , Created , CreatedBy , CreatedDelta , DiscussionText , DocumentId ,
DocumentText , DocumentType , Filename , Filesize , Folder , GeneralText , IsCheckedOut , IsImmutable ,
Metadata , MimeType , Modified , ModifiedBy , ModifiedDelta , Tag , Title , Workflow ,
WorkflowID , WorkflowState , WorkflowStateID

A 'field' may also refer to metadata using the following syntax:
["fieldset name"]["field name"]

Note that 'values' must be contained within "double quotes".

User Interface Features
-----------------------

A) Quick Search widget

This appears on the main navigation bar. Text entered into this widget will be searched according to two options:
1) metadata only
2) filename, title, metadata and document content

B) Text Extractor Diagnostics Plugin

This is available via the dashboard to the administrator.
The results may also be obtained by running the search2/indexing/bin/diagnose.php script.

When browsing through the repository, the search portlet will be available to the right. It will provide a few extra options regarding search.
