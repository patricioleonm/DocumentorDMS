<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>
Use the <b>Subscriptions</b> menu to view and remove existing subscriptions, and add new subscriptions on documents and folders.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Subscribing to a document or folder allows notifications to be sent to you via email (if you have this feature activated on your system) when the document or folder is checked in/checked out, deleted, moved, archived, etc.  
</p>
<br />
<p>
User-specific notifications display on the Dashboard as internal RSS Feeds. Remove a subscription (unsubscribe from the document or folder) to stop receiving notifications.
