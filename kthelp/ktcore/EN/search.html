<h2>Search</h2>
<p>KnowledgeTree provides three versatile search options Â– 
simple (quick) search, advanced search, and saved searches. Search is 
permissions-based, so the system only returns items that the logged in user is 
allowed to access. </p>

<p>Specify a search term to search all text - including 
document metadata and the contents of the following file types (if your 
administrator has configured these options): MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, 
Adobe PDF, and Plain Text files.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> words shorter than 4 characters long (e.g. "the" or 
"for") are discarded from the search.  Search also only ever returns fully matching words
(e.g. "Know" will <strong>not</strong> match "KnowledgeTree").</p>
