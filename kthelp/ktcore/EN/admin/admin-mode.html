<p>
Administrator mode is a system state that allows KnowledgeTree administrative users to override the permissions system, in an audited fashion, in order to access all documents in the system. With administrator mode enabled, Unit administrators will only be provided access to all documents in their Unit. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
Administrator mode provides an audited method of fixing errors on documents or in folders where even administrative users are usually denied access, such as content containing classified information. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
Note: Administrators are not able to delete immutable documents using the 'Delete' button in Browse Documents, even if they're working in Administrator mode. To delete an immutable document, use the 'Delete' action from the immutable document's Document Detail page. This ensures that immutable documents are only deleted one at a time, and avoids the mistaken deletion of an immutable document in a mass action delete.
