<h2>Override Document Check out</h2>
<p>
The KnowledgeTree administrator may override the checked-out status of a document to force a document back in to the repository. This action restores the content version of the document as it was before it was checked out.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Forced check-in is used when a checked out document is urgently required back in the repository so that another user can check out the document to update it, and the original document is no longer available and/or the user who checked that document out is not available to check-in the document.
