<h2>Document Types</h2>
<p>
KnowledgeTree uses Document Types to group documents in the repository. This allows you to search for and manage your documents by 'Document Type', e.g. Invoice, Report, Template, Order, etc.
</p>
<br />
<p>
For each Document Type, you can create a collection of fields, called 'fieldsets', and then associate the fieldsets (one or more) with selected Document Types. For example, for an 'Invoice' document type, you could create a fieldset called 'Invoice Details', for which you can create a collection of fields, such as: Invoice Number, Customer Name, Date, etc. When a user adds a document of the type 'Invoice', the fields display, and the user is required to enter field values, such as the invoice number, the name of the customer, and the date. When adding fieldsets and fields, you can specify whether they are 'required' - i.e. whether the user is must enter values for those fields.
</p>
<br />
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Fields, Fieldsets, and Document Type are Metadata - they are descriptive references for documents in the repository.

<li>Enable / disable the document type</li>
<li>Delete document type (if the document type may be deleted)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<br />

<ul>
<li>change the document type name? Click the Edit icon in the Edit column for the relevant document type. On the editing screen, change the name of the document type. Click Change.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<br />

<h3>ENABLE OR DISABLE A DOCUMENT TYPE</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.	View existing document types in the table on the Document Types page.</li>
<li>2.	Click on the icon in the Enable/Disable column for the relevant document type. If the document type is currently disabled, clicking the icon enables the document type; if the document type is currently enabled, clicking the icon disables the document type.</li>

<li>2.	Click on the fieldset you want to edit (listed in the Associated Fieldsets column for the relevant document type).</li>
<li>3.	On the Edit Fieldset page, to edit the fieldset name, description, and to define whether the fieldset is generic, click Edit these details); you can also manage (add, edit, or remove) fields in the fieldset.</li>

<li>2.	Click the delete icon in the Delete column for the relevant document type.</li>
<b>Note:</b> You may only delete document types that have no associated documents in the repository - i.e. you cannot delete the 'Invoice' document type if you have documents in the repository of the type 'Invoice'. This prevents the removal of required metadata. You may however 'disable' a document type if you have no further use for it.
</ul>
