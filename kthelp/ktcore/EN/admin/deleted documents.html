<h2>Deleted Documents</h2>
<p>
Documents that are deleted from Browse Documents in the DMS are not permanently deleted - they are 'soft deleted' and hidden from view until the system administrator restores those documents or permanently removes them from the system (expunge).
</p>
<br />
<p> 
Expunging deleted documents frees up disk space in your system. Restored documents are returned to their original folder location or to the root directory if the original folder no longer exists.
