<h2>Dynamic Conditions</h2>
<p>
A dynamic condition filters content in the system to selectively apply permissions to documents that meet the criteria of the condition.
</p>
<br />
<p>
After creating the dynamic condition you need to associate permissions with it on the Folder Permissions management page in Browse Documents.

<h3>Dynamic Conditions and Workflows</h3>

Dynamic Conditions are also used to create Guard permissions, which are required to perform transitions on Workflows.
