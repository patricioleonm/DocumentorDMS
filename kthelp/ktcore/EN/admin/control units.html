<h2>Unit Administration</h2>
<p>
KnowledgeTree's <b>Unit</b> concept allows you to arrange the content of your document management system into standalone, separately managed sections.
</p>
<br />
<p>
For example, you may want to create Units that match the business model of your organization, such as a Unit folder for each department or regional office.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Units are also useful where you want to restrict access to certain parts of the DMS for specific users. User-level control is thus set up for specific Units - when these users log on, they will see only the Unit folder/s where they have been granted at least the 'read' permission. All other system folders and files are hidden.
</p>
<br />
<p> 
As with other system folders, Unit level access is controlled through KnowledgeTree's permissions system, by user group, and on specific folders.
</p>
<br />
<p> 
<b>Note:</b> By default, new Unit folders are added to the root directory, but you can specify a different location in the DMS.
</p>
<br />
<p> 
The KnowledgeTree system administrator adds Units, and assigns Unit administrator privileges to one or more users who are responsible for managing content and users in their Unit. The system administrator retains administrator privileges over the entire DMS, including all Units.
