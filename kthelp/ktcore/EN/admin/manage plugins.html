<h2>Manage plugins</h2>
<p>
KnowledgeTree allows the use of Plugins that extend the functionality of the document management system.
</p>
<br />
<p>
View descriptions of the plugins on the Plugins Index at the <a href="http://forge.knowledgetree.com">KnowledgeTree Forge</a>.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Updating Plugins</h3>
<p>
The plugins list must be re-read from the filesystem in the following instances:
<ul>
<li>if you have moved the location of your KnowledgeTree installation to another server</li>
<li>after installing or upgrading KnowledgeTree</li>
<li>if you have installed new plugins or removed unwanted plugins from the filesystem</li>
</ul>
 </p>
<br />
<p>
Rereading the plugins from the filesystem refreshes the plugins list that displays on the Manage Plugins page in the DMS.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Enabling and Disabling Plugins</h3>
<p>
Most plugins are enabled by default. To enable a plugin so that you can use this functionality in the system, select the check box adjacent to the plugin name. To disable a plugin, deselect the check box. When you're done, save your changes.
