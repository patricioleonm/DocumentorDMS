<h2>Browse Collections</h2>

<p>The Browse Collections section allows the user to upload and view
documents in the Document Management System. Documents can be viewed
from three perspectives using the radio buttons:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The
     Folders view is a hierarchical display showing folders and subfolders,
     which correspond to units and subunits.</li>
 <li>The
     Category view displays documents according to the categories assigned to
     each document when they were added. When adding a document, the user is
     prompted to enter the category in which the document belongs. The document
     is subsequently listed under this category.</li>
 <li>The
     Document Type view arranges documents based on their type. Document type
     is assigned when the user adds a new document to the collection.</li>
</ol>

<p>While browsing for documents, use the navigation bar (directly under
the radio buttons) to navigate through the collection.</p>
