<h2>Edit User Preferences</h2>

<p>User preferences can be modified on this page. These properties
include the user's name, e-mail address, mobile number as well as where
to send notifications.</p>

<p>Notifications are based on the folders to which the user is
subscribed, therefore any additions or modifications to documents in the
folder will cause a notification to be sent.  Notifications are also
sent during the document collaboration process if the user is selected
as one of the collaborators.</p>
